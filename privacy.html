  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 23, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Company:</strong> Intrelis</p>
  <p><strong>Contact Email:</strong> contact@bintech.app</p>
  <p><strong>Address:</strong> Eli LeChien, 737 Campus Drive, Stanford, CA 94305</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following data when you use the Bintech app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Info:</strong> Email address, username, and name</li>
    <li><strong>Inventory Info:</strong> Part names, part numbers, descriptions, quanitites, QR/Barcode & datamatrix data, NFC tag UIDs</li>
    <li><strong>Team Info:</strong> Organization name, associated accounts, roles, user item checkout status</li>
    <li><strong>Device Info:</strong> OS version, app version, anonymous crash logs</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Info:</strong> Anonymous usage events and diagnostics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable users to view, create and update their own inventory entries with relevant data</li>
    <li>Allow linking of NFC tag UIDs, QR/barcode data, and DataMatrix data to items</li>
    <li>Support teams by allowing collaborators to view, create and update shared inventory</li>
    <li>Improve app reliability and performance</li>
    <li>Respond to user support requests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Data is stored securely via Supabase, which encrypts data in transit and at rest. Row-level security is used to ensure user data is protected. We do not collect or store passwords. Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Authentication, data processing, and data storage</li>
    <li><strong>Expo / Apple / Google:</strong> For app distribution and diagnostics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These providers may process data on servers outside your country of residence. All services comply with relevant privacy regulations.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing and Team Access</h2>
  <p>Bintech allows users to join teams, where team invites are created via account emails and served in-app. Users who join teams will share their entire inventory data, email, and name with all other members of the team. Currently, there are no granular permissions for viewing or editing inventory — all team members can view and modify shared data. We recommend only joining or creating teams with people you trust, as inventory and profile information is visible to all members.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Data is retained while your account is active. We are currently working on adding a feature that allows users to delete their accounts. In the meantime, you can request account deletion by emailing us at support@bintech.app. Account deletion requests will be processed within 30 days.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Bintech is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn a child has submitted personal information, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your data may be processed or stored in the United States or other countries. By using Bintech, you consent to such transfers.</p>

  <h2>9. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
  <p>You may have rights under laws such as GDPR or CCPA, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accessing your data</li>
    <li>Requesting corrections or deletions</li>
    <li>Objecting to or restricting certain processing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at support@bintech.app.</p>

  <h2>10. Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>Bintech may request access to your camera and NFC hardware to enable barcode scanning and tag reading. These permissions are only used to support app functionality and are never used for background tracking. Bintech only supports read functionality for NFC tags and only references the tag UID. Currently, image data is only used for local ML inference and is not uploaded.</p>

  <h2>11. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>Bintech does not use cookies or persistent tracking technologies. Some anonymous usage data may be collected to improve performance and stability.</p>

  <h2>12. Data Breach Notification</h2>
  <p>In the unlikely event of a data breach, affected users will be notified via the email associated with their account or through an in-app notification.</p>

  <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page and noted in the app if significant.</p>
